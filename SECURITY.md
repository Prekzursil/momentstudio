# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the `main` branch and the latest production deployment derived from it.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Please report privately using one of these channels:

1. GitHub Security Advisory for this repository.
2. Direct contact with the maintainer on GitHub (`@Prekzursil`) if advisory flow is unavailable.

Include, when possible:

- affected endpoint/feature/path
- exact commit SHA or deployment version

- suggested mitigation

## Response Expectations

- We will acknowledge receipt as quickly as possible.
- We will triage severity and communicate status updates during remediation.
- Public disclosure should wait until a fix is available and deployed.
