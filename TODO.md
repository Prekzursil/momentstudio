# TODO / Roadmap

Below is a structured checklist you can turn into issues.

## Project & Infra
- [x] Initialize monorepo with `backend/`, `frontend/`, `infra/`.
- [x] Add `docker-compose.yml` for API, frontend, Postgres.
- [x] Add backend `.env.example` (DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, SMTP_*, FRONTEND_ORIGIN).
- [x] Add frontend `.env.example` (API_BASE_URL, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, APP_ENV).
- [x] Add `.gitignore` for Python, Node, env files, build artifacts.
- [x] GitHub Actions for backend (lint, tests, type-checks).
- [x] GitHub Actions for frontend (lint, tests, build).
- [x] CI: pin Node 24 + npm 11.7.0 in workflows/Dockerfiles.
- [x] Frontend tooling: migrate ESLint to v9 flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`).
- [x] CI: run frontend lint in `Frontend CI`.
- [x] Repo hygiene: ignore local `.serena/` artifacts.
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md with branching, commit style, runbook.
- [x] ARCHITECTURE.md with high-level design and data flow.
- [x] DX: run `alembic upgrade head` in `start.sh` before starting the backend to avoid schema drift.
- [x] CI: add deployment/release job (e.g., container build + push) once runtime code lands.
- [x] E2E: add real browser tests (Playwright) for checkout + admin flows and wire them into CI (Docker-backed).
- [x] DX: detect port collisions in `start.sh` (e.g., `docker compose` already bound to `4200`) and pick a free port or print a clear remediation hint.
- [x] Frontend: eliminate Node 24 `DEP0060 util._extend` deprecation warning (identify dependency via `--trace-deprecation` and upgrade/replace).
- [x] Docs: document seeded owner credentials and that `docker compose down -v` resets the DB (owner needs `bootstrap-owner` again).

## Backend - Core & Auth
- [x] Scaffold FastAPI app with versioned `/api/v1` router.
- [x] Settings via `pydantic-settings`.

- [x] Ops: add `python -m app.cli bootstrap-owner` to create/transfer the owner account (sets username/display name, verifies email).
- [x] Admin UX: add an owner-only “Transfer ownership” control in the admin dashboard (type-to-confirm + current password + audit log entry).
- [x] Notifications: route support/dispute/refund/contact notifications to the owner email and document the policy.
- [x] Notifications: add in-app notifications (list/unread-count/mark read/dismiss) and show them in the header (auto-hide read after 3 days).
- [x] Tests for auth flows (register/login/refresh/invalid creds).
- [x] HTTP-only refresh token cookie issued on login/refresh and cleared on logout.
- [x] Auth: extend user profile fields for registration (first/middle/last name, date of birth, phone) + migration.
