# SEO SSR Phase Evidence

This folder stores evidence artifacts for the SSR crawlability upgrade.

## KPI targets (indexable routes)

- Missing title: `0`
- Missing canonical: `0`
- Missing primary route heading (`h1[data-route-heading="true"]`): `0`
- No meaningful initial HTML text: `0`
- Duplicate title/description: near-zero (allowlist-only intentional duplicates)

## Artifact sources

- `Audit PR Evidence` / `Audit Weekly Evidence` workflow artifacts (`audit-evidence-pack`)
- `seo-content-backlog.json` and `seo-content-backlog.md` generated by:
  - `scripts/seo/generate_content_backlog.py`

## Notes

- Noindex routes are excluded from strict indexed KPI gating.
- Public route checks remain deterministic and versioned in CI artifacts.
