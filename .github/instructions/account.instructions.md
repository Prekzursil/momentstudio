# Account Instructions

Scope:

- `frontend/src/app/pages/account/**`
- `frontend/src/app/pages/auth/**`
- `frontend/src/app/pages/tickets/**`

Rules:

- Keep account workflows self-service and task-focused.
- Do not duplicate admin controls in account pages.
- Minimize visual clutter:
  - no competing primary actions in the same section.
- Respect privacy/security UX:
  - sensitive actions need clear confirmation and error handling.
- Keep route meta and heading semantics coherent for auditability.
