## Baseline Notes

1. Percy and Applitools checks are operational and green on manual `main` dispatch.
2. Weekly evidence is green and produces artifact packs successfully.
3. Weekly agent is currently broken for `severe_count == 0` due a shell heredoc parsing defect in `.github/workflows/audit-weekly-agent.yml` (`Sync severe issues to roadmap project` step), causing syntax error before the intended early exit path.
4. Stale deep-audit tracker issues linked to already closed/merged PRs existed before this batch and were closed during reconciliation.
